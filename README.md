# storagespaces-single-node-template

This template is a very simple template that deploys a Windows VM and configures Storage Spaces in Stand Alone mode.

It assumes you already have a resource group with a Virtual Network deployed and that you have remote access from a jumpbox or through the network via VPN or Express Route since we are not deploying public ip address for this VM.

This is for testing purposes, depending on your workload Storage Spaces Direct is a better option. For more information about Storage Spaces please refer to:

[Storage Spaces overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/overview)

#### Cloning the source sample project and executing deployment script
1. Change folder to your clouddrive so any changes gets persisted in the storage account assigned to your cloudshell
   ```bash
   cd ~/clouddrive
   ```
1. Clone this repository with the following git command
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/paulomarquesc/storagespaces-standalone-template.git
   ```
1. Change folder to storagespaces-standalone-template
   ```bash
   cd storagespaces-standalone-template
   ```
1. Review and change the parameters file as needed before deploying (you can use "vi" or "code" inside Azure Cloudshell for this operation)
   *  azuredeploy.parameters.json

1. Execute the deployment script the template (make sure you change command line arguments)
    * azuredeploy.json
        ```bash
        ./Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.sh -g test-rg -l eastus -v mykeyvault
        ```

To know all script deployment options, please execute the script wihtout any parameter.
    
    ```bash
    pmcadmin@pmarques-pc01:/mnt/c/data/git/storagespaces-standalone-template$ ./Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.sh
